# Custom Database Contexts

Control the database accesses in your application.

## Overview

Applications can perform unrestricted read and write database accesses from their SwiftUI views, for convenience, or rapid prototyping. See <doc:GettingStarted> for such a setup.

Some apps have other needs, though:

- An app that enforces **database invariants** must disallow unrestricted writes. Database invariants are important for the integrity of application data, as described in the [GRDB Concurrency Guide]. 
- An app that connects to **multiple databases** and has to specify which database a `@Query` property connects to.

We will address those needs below.

## Removing write access from a DatabaseContext

An application controls the ``DatabaseContext`` that is present in the SwiftUI environment. It is read-only if it is created with the ``DatabaseContext/readOnly(_:)`` factory method, even if its underlying database connection can write.

```swift
import GRDBQuery
import SwiftUI

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MyView()
        }
        .databaseContext(.readOnly { /* a GRDB connection */ })
    }
}
```

With a read-only context, all attempts to perform writes via the `databaseContext` environment value will fail with ``DatabaseContextError/readOnly``.

## Controlling writes with a custom database manager

Now that it is impossible to perform unrestricted writes from the `databaseContext` environment, some applications need views to perform controlled database writes â€” again, for convenience, or rapid prototyping.

This is case of the [GRDBQuery demo app], that uses the techniques described here.

Define a "database manager" type that declares the set of permitted writes. For example:

```swift
import GRDB

struct PlayerRepository {
    private let writer: GRDB.DatabaseWriter
}

extension PlayerRepository {
    /// Inserts a player.
    func insert(_ player: Player) {
        try writer.write { ... }
    }
    
    /// Deletes all players.
    func deletePlayers() throws {
        try writer.write { ... }
    }
}
```

Then, define a custom SwiftUI environment key for the database manager:

```swift
import SwiftUI

private struct PlayerRepositoryKey: EnvironmentKey {
    /// The default dbQueue is an empty in-memory database
    static var defaultValue: PlayerRepository { /* default PlayerRepository */ }
}

extension EnvironmentValues {
    var playerRepository: PlayerRepository {
        get { self[PlayerRepositoryKey.self] }
        set { self[PlayerRepositoryKey.self] = newValue }
    }
}

extension View {
    /// Sets the `playerRepository` environment value.
    func playerRepository(_ repository: PlayerRepository) -> some View {
        self.environment(\.playerRepository, repository)
    }
}
```

Now, the application can inject a `PlayerRepository` in the environment, and views can use it to write in the database:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MyView()
        }
        .playerRepository(/* a repository */)
    }
}

struct DeletePlayersButton: View {
    @Environment(\.playerRepository) var playerRepository

    var body: some View {
        Button("Delete Players") {
            do {
                try playerRepository.deletePlayers()
            } catch {
                // Handle error 
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, let SwiftUI views use the `@Query` property wrapper, as below:

1. Expose a read-only access from the database manager.
2. Update the `View.playerRepository(_:)` method so that it puts a read-only database context in the environment.

```swift
extension PlayerRepository {
    /// Provides a read-only access to the database.
    var reader: GRDB.DatabaseReader { writer }
}

extension View {
    /// Sets both the `playerRepository` (for writes) and `databaseContext`
    /// (for `@Query`) environment values.
    func playerRepository(_ repository: PlayerRepository) -> some View {
        self
            .environment(\.playerRepository, repository)
            .databaseContext(.readOnly { repository.reader })
    }
}
```

Now everything is working as expected: views can perform controlled writes, and use the `@Query` propoerty wrapper.

## Replacing DatabaseContext with a custom database manager, and connecting to multiple databases

It is also possible to get rid of `DatabaseContext` entirely, and perform all database accesses from a database manager.

This technique can be used to prevent unrestricted reads. It is also useful in applications that connect to multiple databases (just define multiple database managers).   

First, stop defining the `databaseContext` environment value, since it is useless.

For `@Query` to be able to feed from a database manager, it is necessary to instruct `Queryable` types to access the database through this database manager, instead of `DatabaseContext`.

- For ``Queryable`` types, build the publisher from a database manager instead of a database context:

    ```swift
    struct MyRequest: Queryable {
        // Instead of publisher(in context: DatabaseContext) 
        func publisher(in repository: PlayerRepository) -> AnyPublisher<Value, Error> {
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

- For convenience protocols ``ValueObservationQueryable``, ``PresenceObservationQueryable`` and ``FetchQueryable``, have the database manager conform to ``TopLevelDatabaseReader``, and explicitly define the context type in queryable types:

    ```swift
    extension PlayerRepository: TopLevelDatabaseReader {
        /// Provides a read-only access to the database.
        var reader: GRDB.DatabaseReader { writer }
    }

    struct PlayersRequest: ValueObservationQueryable {
        typealias Context = PlayerRepository // ðŸ‘ˆ Custom context
        static var defaultValue: [Player] { [] }

        func fetch(_ db: Database) throws -> [Player] {
            try Player.fetchAll(db)
        }
    }
    ```

Finally, instruct `@Query` to connect to the database manager, with an explicit environment key (see <doc:CustomDatabaseContexts#Controlling-writes-with-a-custom-database-manager> above):

```swift
struct PlayerList: View {
    @Query(PlayersRequest(), in: \.playerRepository) // ðŸ‘ˆ Custom environment key
    var players: [Player]
    
    var body: some View {
        List(players) { player in Text(player.name) }
    }
}
```

> Tip: It is possible to use a `@Query` that connects to a custom database manager without specifying an explicit environment key in each and every view.

> extension Query where Request.Context == PlayerRepository {

>         self.init(request, in: \.playerRepository)
>     }
>
>     /// Creates a `Query` that feeds from the `playerRepository`

>     init(_ request: Binding<Request>) {
>         self.init(request, in: \.playerRepository)
>     }
>
>     /// Creates a `Query` that feeds from the `playerRepository`
>     /// environment key, given a `Queryable` request.
>     init(constant request: Request) {
>         self.init(constant: request, in: \.playerRepository)
>     }
> }
> ```

> These initializers will streamline your SwiftUI views:
>
> ```swift
> struct PlayerList: View {
>     // Implicitly uses 'playerRepository'
>     @Query(PlayersRequest()) var players: [Player]
>
>     ...
> }
