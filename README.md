This library helps building SwiftUI applications that access "services", such as a local database, through the SwiftUI environment.

Its main purpose is to help users of the [GRDB] SQLite toolkit. Yet GRDBQuery has no dependency on GRDB: you can use it in other contexts, in a Core Data or Realm application, and generally in any kind of app, as long as you'd like to put the SwiftUI environment to good use. 

## What's in the Box?

GRDBQuery provides two property wrappers:

- With **`@Query`**, SwiftUI views can automatically update their content when the database changes. Generally speaking, `@Query` helps subscribing to Combine publishers defined from the SwiftUI environment:

    ```swift
    /// A view that displays an always up-to-date list of players in the database.
    struct PlayerList: View {
        @Query(PlayersRequest())
        var players: [Player]
        
        var body: some View {
            List(players) { player in Text(player.name) }
        }
    }
    ```

- With **`@EnvironmentStateObject`**, applications can build observable objects that find their dependencies in the SwiftUI environment:

    ```swift
    /// A view that displays the list of players provided by its view model
    struct PlayerList: View {
        @EnvironmentStateObject var viewModel: PlayerListViewModel
        
        init() {
            _viewModel = EnvironmentStateObject { env in
                PlayerListViewModel(database: env.database)
            }
        }
        
        var body: some View {
            List(viewModel.players) { player in Text(player.name) }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    `@EnvironmentStateObject` is a general-purpose property wrapper, akin to the SwiftUI `@Environment`, `@EnvironmentObject`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@StateObject`.
    
    It fits well the view models of the MVVM architecture, as well as dependency injection. 

## How to Handle Database Errors?

## Why GRDBQuery?

**GRDBQuery makes sure SwiftUI views are *immediately* rendered with the content you expect.**

For example, when you display a `List` that animates its changes, you do not want to see an animation for the *initial* state of the list, or to prevent this undesired animation with extra code.

You also want your SwiftUI previews to display the expected values *without having to run them*.

Techniques based on [`onAppear(perform:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onappear(perform:)), [`onReceive(_:perform)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onreceive(_:perform:)) and similar methods suffer from this "double-rendering" problem and its side effects. By contrast, the GRDBQuery property wrappers have you fully covered.

## Thanks

ðŸ™Œ `@Query` was vastly inspired from [Core Data and SwiftUI](https://davedelong.com/blog/2021/04/03/core-data-and-swiftui/) by [@davedelong](https://github.com/davedelong), with [a critical improvement](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/pull/955) contributed by [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete). Many thanks to both of you! `@EnvironmentStateObject` was later introduced because `@Query` does not fit the MVVM architecture. The author sees benefits in both property wrappers.
